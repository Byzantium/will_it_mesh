## byzantium_configd.py ##
A (relatively) simple daemon that automatically configures wireless interfaces on a Byzantium node.  No user interaction is required.  Much of this code was taken from the control panel, it's just been assembled into a more compact form.  The default network settings are the same ones used by Commotion Wireless, so this means that our respective projects are now seamlessly interoperable.  For the record, we tested this in Red Hook in November of 2012 and it works.
